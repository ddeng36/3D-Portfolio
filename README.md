## 3D-Portfolio
This is a web application that displays 3D models in a responsive way. I learned how to build it from [Lam Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qALsVa-V9qo&t=143s), and have made some modifications to fit my needs.
## Usage
To use this app, simply navigate to the deployed version here and interact with the 3D models using your mouse or touchpad. Alternatively, you can download the code and run it locally on your machine by following these steps:
